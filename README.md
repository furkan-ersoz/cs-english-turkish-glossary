# cs-english-turkish-glossary
This glossary contains English terms and their Turkish explanations, recorded while studying computer science subjects. The terms are categorized by subject, making it a potential dictionary for both computer science terminology and regular vocabulary.

About the Subjects
The glossary includes terms from subjects such as data analysis, data science, object-oriented programming, artificial intelligence, recommender systems, and operating systems. However, the words are not always strictly related to these subjects. They were added while studying these topics, so some terms might be general or unrelated. Additionally, there are extra words related to music production and Excel. While they may seem out of context, they provide useful vocabulary for various scenarios. Therefore, it’s recommended not to remove these words.

Who Can Use cs-e-t-glossary
If you speak Turkish and are not familiar with all the English terms in computer engineering, this glossary can help you in several ways:
*Starting a new subject: If you're just beginning to learn a topic, you can check the terms categorized under that subject. Knowing some key words beforehand can be very helpful.
*Building your own glossary: With a variety of terms, it’s easy to forget translations after a few days. Like me, you might want to save the information to revisit later. Creating your own explanations can often be more effective than relying on translation websites or AI tools like ChatGPT.

How to Use cs-e-t-glossary
The data table will be shared as an Excel file, along with the MySQL table creation and insertion scripts. You can:
*Use MySQL: Download the files and use the MySQL scripts to create a database table, then insert the data.
*Use Excel directly: If you don't want to use MySQL, use the Excel file directly. Sort by subject to categorize or search for specific terms.
